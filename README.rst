# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

This is a modified version of Scikit-Optimize. You can now add "space_constraint" to skopt. 

Additionally, you can use the following options with constrained optimization using the present modification of skopt:
initial_point_generator="grid_modified",
initial_point_generator="lhs_modified",
initial_point_generator="lhs_pydoe",
initial_point_generator="sobol_scipy",

About Scikit-Optimize:

Scikit-Optimize
===============

Scikit-Optimize, or ``skopt``, is a simple and efficient library to
minimize (very) expensive and noisy black-box functions. It implements
several methods for sequential model-based optimization. ``skopt`` aims
to be accessible and easy to use in many contexts.

The library is built on top of NumPy, SciPy and Scikit-Learn.

We do not perform gradient-based optimization. For gradient-based
optimization algorithms look at
``scipy.optimize``
`here <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html>`_.
